    <article class="work teacher">

      <div class="about-teacher work-description"><h2>English First </h2><p>Worked as an English teacher at this private language institution in Tianjin, China. I was responsible for planning and delivering 20 hours of unique lessons per week to a wide range of age and English levels. Being able to plan everything from lessons with 3-year-olds that could yet speak Chinese coherently, let alone English, to classes of 15 and 16-year-olds that dealt with advanced, complex vocabulary and grammar structures provided me with ample opportunity to hone my interpersonal communication skills.

      <div class="about-newspaper work-description"><h2>Sun Newspapers</h2><p>Worked as a free-lance writer and occasional copy editor. Writing and editing articles for a widely circulated local newspaper like the Sun allowed me to become more proficient and knowledgeable about English grammar and writing rules through continued practice and feedback from my editors and fellow writers.</p>
