      <div class="about-turing education-description"><h2>The Turing School of Software and Design</h2><p>I was a member of the inaugural front-end engineering cohort. This intensive, seven-month long program helped me build a solid foundation in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. In addition to the technical skills I learned, Turing taught me how to think like a programmer and, more importantly, learn like a programmer. Turing instilled in me the confidence to jump into new languages and frameworks and trust that I'll be able to figure out how to best utilize them.</p>

      <div class="about-uf education-description"><h2>University of Florida</h2><p>Majored in Religious Studies at this prestigious public university. In addition to learning about a wide range of religions and issues relating to the worldâ€™s religions, my studies provided me with ample opportunities to improve my reading, writing, and critical thinking abilities. The course of study also enabled me to enhance my already firm grasp of the English language, as each semester I was required to read thousands of pages and write roughly 75 pages of original academic writing. The production of this writing meant that I also had to become proficient at properly citing and documenting sources in academic papers, a valuable skill that I am willing and eager to instill in my students. .</p>
